# Mocking unittest in python

This script was written in the course Software Testing.
The task was to perform unittests with mocking capabilities.


I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)

### Run the script
This script will need to get several components installed, see the file main.py and test.py for extensions to install.
```python
$ python test.py
```
